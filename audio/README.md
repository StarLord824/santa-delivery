## ⚠️ Notes

1. **File Format**: Use `.wav` for best compatibility (`.ogg` also works)
2. **Duration**: Music should be 30-60 seconds for easy looping
3. **Volume**: Normalize all files to similar volume levels
4. **Bit Rate**: 16-bit, 44.1kHz is ideal for chiptune

## 🎮 The game will run silently if audio files are missing!
